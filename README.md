### Re-Directly

The code is available here, to run this code you need to download python using this link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
After that you can open cmd, go to the directory where the redirect.py is stored, (downloads file probably), and run the command "python redirect.py" 
This will execute the script the same way the redirect.exe would, you can check that there are no malicious code there.
Make sure to open cmd as an admin, or else it won't be able to run the code.
